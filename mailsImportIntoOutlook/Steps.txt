				Dear Yugensys Team

	To import Zoho email files into Outlook, follow these steps:

1. Begin by extracting the Zoho email zip folder that you exported individually, including the Inbox, Sent, Notifications, and Newsletter folders.
2. Install the file named "Install.exe" found within the extracted folder.
3. Once installation is complete, run the "savemail.vbs" script by double-clicking on it.
4. A popup message will appear prompting you to select the source folder that you wish to import first.
5. Another popup will appear in your Outlook application, allowing you to choose the destination folder where you want to import the emails.
6. Click on the "Agree" button and then click "OK".
7. The email files will begin importing.
8. Once the import is complete, a popup message will appear confirming that the files have been imported successfully.
9. Repeat these steps for any additional folders you wish to import.
